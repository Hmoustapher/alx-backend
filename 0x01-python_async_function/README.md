# Python - Async

## Project Overview

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python, specifically using the `asyncio` library. Through a series of tasks, you will learn how to work with coroutines, asynchronous functions, and concurrent programming. The goal is to develop a deep understanding of how to write efficient, non-blocking code that can handle multiple tasks at once.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the syntax and usage of `async` and `await` in Python.
- Execute asynchronous programs using the `asyncio` library.
- Run concurrent coroutines to perform tasks concurrently.
- Create and manage `asyncio` tasks.
- Use the `random` module to simulate delays and randomize results in asynchronous programs.

## Project Tasks

### Task 0: The Basics of Async

Create an asynchronous coroutine `wait_random` that takes an integer argument `max_delay` (default value of 10). The coroutine should wait for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` seconds and return the delay value.

#### Example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio
wait_random = __import__('0-basic_async_syntax').wait_random

print(asyncio.run(wait_random()))
print(asyncio.run(wait_random(5)))
print(asyncio.run(wait_random(15)))
Task 1: Execute Multiple Coroutines
In this task, you will import wait_random and write a new asynchronous coroutine wait_n that spawns wait_random multiple times (specified by the n argument). The function should return the list of all delays in ascending order, without using sort().

Example:
python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio
wait_n = __import__('1-concurrent_coroutines').wait_n

print(asyncio.run(wait_n(5, 5)))
print(asyncio.run(wait_n(10, 7)))
print(asyncio.run(wait_n(10, 0)))
Task 2: Measure the Runtime
Modify the previous task to include a measure_time function that measures the total execution time of wait_n. The function should return the total time divided by n.

Example:
python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python3

measure_time = __import__('2-measure_runtime').measure_time

n = 5
max_delay = 9

print(measure_time(n, max_delay))
Task 3: Task - Wait for Random
Write a function task_wait_random that takes an integer max_delay and returns an asyncio.Task.

Example:
python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio
task_wait_random = __import__('3-tasks').task_wait_random

async def test(max_delay: int) -> float:
    task = task_wait_random(max_delay)
    await task
    print(task.__class__)

asyncio.run(test(5))
Task 4: Task - Wait for Multiple Coroutines
In this task, alter the wait_n function to create a new function task_wait_n. Instead of calling wait_random directly, call task_wait_random to create tasks.

Example:
python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio
task_wait_n = __import__('4-tasks').task_wait_n

n = 5
max_delay = 6
print(asyncio.run(task_wait_n(n, max_delay)))
Requirements
General Requirements:
All files should end with a new line.
Your files must be executable.
The first line of each file should be #!/usr/bin/env python3.
Your code should adhere to PEP 8 (Python style guide).
All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
All modules and functions should be properly documented.
